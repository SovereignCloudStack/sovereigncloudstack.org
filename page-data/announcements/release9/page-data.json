For many participants, there was no question\nthat building open standards and open source software together is what we need\nto do now in order to make progress with digitization and ensure that we\nhave control, innovation and value creation capabilities.</p>\n<p>The SCS community does also produce a complete modular open source software\nstack that implements the SCS standards and that is used in pieces or as a\nwhole by more than half a dozen providers to offer public or private cloud\nservices. The technology can certainly be considered tried and proven powering\npublic clouds for years without any unplanned outages and for example providing\nthe cloud platform for the \"BayernCloud Schule\" which is used by many hundreds\nof thousands of students and parents and teachers in Bavaria every day.</p>\n<p>The SCS software receives continuous updates by the community. Twice a year,\nit goes the extra mile to craft a release and take extra time to communicate\nthe progress and plan the next half year. In the summit week, the release 9\nof the software was completed.</p>\n<h3>Improved hardware management</h3>\n<p>While users have the power of standardized APIs to manage their virtual\nmachine and container environments, the cloud operators have to deal with\ntheir hardware which tends to grow more diverse over time. With the work\non netbox-manager, the capabilities to generate configuration for the\nhardware have been extended especially for networking gear. A web-interface\nhas been added to make it easier to keep an overview over events and status.</p>\n<h3>Current software</h3>\n<p>On the virtualization side, OSISM-10.x now provides the current OpenStack\n2025.1 (Epoxy) release. As SCS operators have come to expect, the upgrade\nfrom the previous version has been validated extensively. For the first\ntime, skipping over one release is supported, so a one-step upgrade from\nOSISM-8.x (with OpenStack 2024.1 Caracal) is also possible, not just from\nOSISM-9.x (with OpenStack 2024.2 Dalmatian).</p>\n<p>The newer OpenStack releases come with the upstreamed domain manager role\nthat the SCS community has worked on and contributed, providing a well-defined\nrole for enabling self-service user and project management.\nThe handling of pass-through PCI devices has been improved, supporting\nlive-migrations in a broader range of scenarios despite the pass-through.\nThis can help specifically with GPU accelerated AI workloads.</p>\n<p>The mature ceph storage technology has been upgrade to the Reef release.\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS is now used as the default operating system on the hosts,\nbringing support for the latest server hardware and improved performance.</p>\n<p>The provided container node images also used Ubuntu 24.04 LTS now. Having\nthe latest kernel optimizations is also relevant for the guest images; and\nwith the more and more relevant GPU pass-through for AI acceleration,\nsometimes even hardware support. With current kernels, it is also ensured\nthat latest innovation e.g. with eBPF being used for container networking\nwith cilium can be leveraged.</p>\n<p>The latest version for kubernetes cluster-API and the cluster-API provider\nare used, staying in sync with the upstream progress. SCS R9 comes with\nsupport for Kubernetes-1.33.x, bringing enhancements with scalability,\ntoken handling and pod management.</p>\n<h3>Simplifying maintenance with new cluster stack</h3>\n<p>SCS Kubernetes clusters need the ability to talk to the underlying OpenStack\nplatform to create resources such as persistent volumes or load balancers and\nthus need a secret to authenticate their requests. The duality of two different\nsecret formats has been cleaned up, also making it possible to support\nself-signed CAs without hassle. Given this change, the community has taken the\nopportunity to rationalize the ClusterClass variables that users use to\ncustomize their clusters. The helm charts for the add-ons (such as CNI, CSI,\nCCM, metrics) no longer need to be bundled in the releases but are pulled\nalongside the images now.</p>\n<p>This simplifies maintenance going forward. It does however introduce a breaking\nchange, so the \"scs2\" cluster stack series was started, succeeding the old\n\"scs\" series. Documentation and tooling to automate the conversion will be\nprovided soon. The community has committed to maintain the new cluster stack\nseries and to continuously provide the artifacts to ensure that users can\neasily deploy the kubernetes patch levels short-term order to stay secure.</p>\n<h3>Future</h3>\n<p>Beyond following the upstream technology evolution and continuing to adapting\nto it, the SCS community will work on improving the technology e.g. with\nrespect to performance and federation capabilities. Many of the contributing\ncompanies are inspired and driven by the requests of their customers, e.g. by\nthe increasing number of VMware to SCS migrations. The SCS\ncommunity continues to provide the well-established mechanisms to encourage for\ncommunication and collaboration on those. This increase the chances that\nfeatures (and of course bug-fixes) can be reintegrated in the common code base\nof the larger SCS community and the upstream communities.\nThis extends beyond the current scope of the software\nreleases. Additional software that implements the SCS standards is encouraged\nto leverage those same mechanisms.</p>\n<p>The next releases are open to including more alternatives for the existing\nsoftware platform, but the focus is mainly on\ndoing the standardization and software implementation work to be the ideal\nfoundation to run services and workloads on top of SCS-standardized\nsuitable standards and software that supports it.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"b8aebdda-27e7-519c-99da-f3892dfa830c","language":"en","slug":"release9","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"defaultLanguage":"en","generateDefaultLanguagePage":false,"routed":false,"originalPath":"/announcements/release9/","path":"/announcements/release9/"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1406175617","1529705390","2744905544"],"slicesMap":{}}
