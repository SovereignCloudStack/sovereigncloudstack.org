The reference implementation now also includes the\nObservability Platform and enhanced Identity and Access Management. The\ncollaboration with ALASCA e.V. has resulted in enhanced speed and scope in the\ndevelopment of comprehensive open standards, in line with the requirements of\nthe German Administrative Cloud Strategy. Overall, SCS Release 6 offers an\neasy-to-operate, sovereign full-stack cloud solution.</p>\n<p>SCS provides all the cloud technology foundations for realizing digital\nsovereignty and implementing open source strategies. Many users of cloud\nservices from the public sector, but also from the private sector and science,\nexpect \"cloud\" to be container-based technology that can ideally be hosted and\noperated in a digitally sovereign manner. This is now even easier to achieve:\nSCS offers a digitally sovereign, secure, complete, standardized open source\ncontainer layer as the basis for all containerized applications.</p>\n<h3>SCS Full Stack: Unification of IaaS and KaaS reference implementation completed</h3>\n<p>Release 6 introduces the Cluster Stacks, the second version of the Kubernetes\nas a Service reference implementation from SCS, which can now be seamlessly\nrolled out on the Infrastructure as a Service layer from SCS thanks to the\nimplementation of the Cluster Stack Operator. The cluster stacks are fully\nimplemented with Kubernetes on-board tools such as operators and thus replace\nthe old implementation, which still integrated and automated the cluster API\nwith the help of scripts. The cluster stacks are complemented with identity and\naccess management and an observability platform which ensure that the stack is\nmore secure and easier to operate.</p>\n<p>SCS thus offers an integrated full-stack cloud solution that combines a\nscalable, secure cloud infrastructure and a container platform that can be\ndeveloped and tested according to the latest requirements. SCS continues to\noffer a fully open standards-based software solution developed openly by many\ncontributors, which can be influenced and shaped by operators and users and\noffers a high degree of transparency - the perfect basis for driving digitally\nsovereign innovation at all levels in Germany and Europe.</p>\n<h3>Cooperation on standardization</h3>\n<p>In the fall of last year, the cooperation between the SCS project and ALASCA\ne.V. was intensified once again. The further development of open standards, as\ncalled for in the German Administrative Cloud Strategy, for example, is at the\nforefront of this cooperation. Release 6 shows how fruitful this cooperation\nalready is, with examples of SCS standards including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New stable version 4 for the SCS-compatible IaaS certification.</li>\n<li>New draft version 1 for the new SCS-compatible KaaS certification.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the operators of SCS cloud environments, it is an advantage that the\nimplementation of the standards and the resulting certification provides them\nwith a simple quality criterion (in the best sense of the word) that relates\nnot only to interoperability and openness, but also to robustness, security and\nup-to-dateness. In this way, they not only assure their customers of the\nquality of their offering, but also themselves. Of course, interoperability is\nof particular interest to users: they can roll out their workloads on the\nclouds of multiple operators without any major surprises, which gives them a\nhigh degree of flexibility and in some cases may be a prerequisite to open up\nan alternative to the large hyperscalers (AWS, Google, Azure).</p>\n<h3>Simple operation of cloud environments</h3>\n<p>Overall, Release 6 makes it clear that SCS cloud infrastructure can be operated\nefficiently: this was and is one of the central value propositions of the SCS\nproject, alongside control and simple provisioning for end users. The operating\ntools have been consistently expanded to simplify everyday work steps for the\noperating staff. The continuous standardization of further aspects and\nespecially the implementation of the standards by providers who do not use the\nIaaS reference implementation underline the relevance of the standardization\nwork. With the latest developments and the release of Cluster Stacks for\nOpenStack, deployment environments for Kubernetes clusters are easier and more\nefficient to manage.</p>\n<p>In the reference environment, a standardized Kubernetes environment is now also\navailable at the infrastructure level, into which operators can integrate their\nown tools (e.g. for billing or capacity management); with the Identity and\nAccess Management (IAM) from the SCS reference implementation, a supplied\nservice also makes use of this integration option. The expansion of the SCS\ndocumentation also contributes directly to the efficient operation of SCS cloud\nenvironments; examples, instructions and links to the repositories make the\nstructure of SCS clear, comprehensible and efficient.</p>\n<h3>About the Sovereign Cloud Stack Project</h3>\n<p>SCS has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate\nProtection (BMWK) since July 2021 and is run by the Open Source Business\nAlliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität e.V.. A growing,\ninternational ecosystem of now over 25 companies contributes to the success of\nthe Sovereign Cloud Stack with over 50 software developers. Together, open\nstandards for a modern, federatable open source cloud and container platform\nare defined and implemented in an open development process using proven open\nsource components. At the same time, operational knowledge and practice is\nbeing made transparently available to minimize the difficulty of delivering\nhigh-quality and secure cloud services. Already six providers are using SCS\ntechnology productively to operate truly sovereign and GDPR-compliant public\ncloud offerings. Additional SCS-based cloud infrastructure (public and private\nclouds) is under construction. SCS also contributes to Gaia-X and provides the\ndevelopment platform for the Gaia-X Federation Services / Cross-Federation\nService Components (GXFS/XFSC).</p>\n<h3>About the Open Source Business Alliance (OSB Alliance) e.V.</h3>\n<p>The Open Source Business Alliance (OSB Alliance) is the association of the open\nsource industry in Germany. It represents over 200 member companies that\ngenerate more than EUR 126 billion annually in total. Together with scientific\ninstitutions and user organizations, it works to sustainably anchor the central\nimportance of open source software and open standards for a successful digital\ntransformation in the public awareness. In addition, innovations in the field\nof open source are to be promoted. The goal of the OSB Alliance is to establish\nopen source as a standard in public procure­ment and in research and business\ndevelopment. After all, open source and open standards are compelling\nfoundations for digital sovereignty, innovation capability and security in the\ndigital transformation and thus the answer to one of the greatest challenges of\nour time.</p>\n<h3>Related links:</h3>\n<p>Sovereign Cloud Stack: <a href=\"https://scs.community/\">https://scs.community/</a></p>\n<p>Technical Documentation SCS: <a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/docs\">https://docs.scs.community/docs</a></p>\n<p>SCS Repositories (github): <a href=\"https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack\">https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack</a></p>\n<p>Release notes: <a href=\"https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes\">https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/release-notes</a></p>\n<p>SCS’s notion of digital sovereignty: <a href=\"https://the-report.cloud/why-digital-sovereignty-is-more-than-mere-legal-compliance/\">https://the-report.cloud/why-digital-sovereignty-is-more-than-mere-legal-compliance/</a>\nand <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11623-022-1669-5?sharing_token=ie7xTVzv_afod07w5Y2lJfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4yFyxh9Qw2iCtygUYjun7MI5leBYqiHZBlIeTPv8Sm1Wv8c1dEUf6ebSwnRfo99_nAYh2FgwUyIHjFyZFWv_EIOEIetr2eBSiAPrI68ptBgKxMVkNlS4udZRAhx1X-WB8=\">https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11623-022-1669-5?sharing_token=ie7xTVzv_afod07w5Y2lJfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4yFyxh9Qw2iCtygUYjun7MI5leBYqiHZBlIeTPv8Sm1Wv8c1dEUf6ebSwnRfo99_nAYh2FgwUyIHjFyZFWv_EIOEIetr2eBSiAPrI68ptBgKxMVkNlS4udZRAhx1X-WB8=</a></p>\n<p>Release Blog Posts: <a href=\"https://scs.community/de/2023/12/27/scs-r6-enables/\">https://scs.community/de/2023/12/27/scs-r6-enables/</a>\nand <a href=\"https://scs.community/de/2024/02/01/road-ro-r6/\">https://scs.community/de/2024/02/01/road-ro-r6/</a></p>\n<p>Copyright picture: Engin Akyurd</p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong></p>\n<p>OSB Alliance – Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität e.V., Pariser Platz 6a, 10117 Berlin, Germany</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"e38ca748-410e-500c-88dd-0a87f9f07ef8","language":"en","slug":"release6","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"defaultLanguage":"en","generateDefaultLanguagePage":false,"routed":false,"originalPath":"/announcements/release6/","path":"/announcements/release6/"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1406175617","1529705390","2744905544"],"slicesMap":{}}
