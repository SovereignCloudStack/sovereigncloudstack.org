Organizations, companies and governments worldwide are looking for\nways to keep control over their own digital infrastructure and their data -\nindependent, secure and built upon open standards. This is where <a href=\"https://sovereigncloudstack.org/\">Sovereign\nCloud Stack (SCS)</a> comes into play.</p>\n<p>SCS is not just the response to the demand for operating digitally sovereign\ninfrastructure - it also comes with and educational side. Because true\nsovereignty can only emerge when human develop a deep understanding of the used\ntechnology - and gain competency to operate it.</p>\n<h2>Collaboration with GovStack: Combining standards, knowledge and practice</h2>\n<p>A comprehensive training program that fosters digital sovereignty by practice\nin operating clouds was developed together with the the international initiative\n<a href=\"https://govstack.global/\">GovStack</a>. GovStack globally supports the setup of\ndigital services by defining standardised building blocks, test and demo\nenvironments as well as a market place for interoperable open solutions.</p>\n<p>The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) project <a href=\"https://scs.community/2024/12/04/GovStack/\">actively contributes to\nGovStack</a>: SCS provided significant\ninput for the development of GovStack's <a href=\"https://govstack.gitbook.io/bb-cloud-infrastructure\">Cloud Infrastructure Building\nBlock</a>.  The SCS reference\nimplementation is also listed as a conforming solution on the <a href=\"https://www.govstack.global/software/\">govstack\nmarket</a> - an important milestone in the\nquest to provide more trust and international adoption of sovereign cloud\ntechnology.</p>\n<p>An important part of the collaboration is a training program, which teaches\nboth technical foundations and practical experience. It encompasses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Self-study via online material,</li>\n<li>a one-week course on the foundations,</li>\n<li>several weeks of practical work with test environments (e.g. \"Cloud-in-a-Box\"),</li>\n<li>and an advanced training course with focus on real-world operations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal of this program is to enable engaged participants to operate a\ncomplete SCS cloud environment (including virtualization and container layer\nas well as the tooling) on their own -- with occasional support by external\npartners.</p>\n<h2>SCS in Africa: Successful training in Kenya</h2>\n<p>An outstanding example for the implementation of this training program is the\nfirst advanced course that took place in Nairobi, Kenya, in May of 2025. Over\n20 participants from Kenya, Somalia, and Djibouti gathered for an intense week\nof trainings. Most of them had participated in the foundational courses before\nwhich Karsten Samaschke had lead in a number of African countries.</p>\n<p>The trainings was organized and paid for by the <a href=\"https://itu.int/\">ITU</a>\n(International Telecommunications Union, Geneva) and\n<a href=\"https://giz.de/en/\">GIZ</a> (German Society for International Cooperation,\nBonn/Eschborn). There was live translation into French for the French-speaking\nparticipants, so everyone was able to actively participate without language\nbarriers.</p>\n<p>The training week in Nairobi was characterized by intense interactions from\nhighly motivated participants. Some challenges existed - last not least the\ncommon lack of available infrastructure in the participants' home countries to\nprepare for the course. Despite this, there was concentrated and active\nparticipation where the participants were able to build a solid foundation of\nknowledge and experience. With some further practice and possibly some more\ntrainings, they will be able to become self-reliant in setting up and\nreliably operating an SCS Cloud.</p>\n<h2>Learning by Doing: Cloud-in-a-Box as local training environment</h2>\n<p>The training had a clear structure: Explain, test, apply.\nIn numerous small modules, topics were introduced and explained.\nThe participants then got the opportunity to apply the learnings directly\nafterwards with practical assignments - with some supervision by the trainers\nbut largely on their own.</p>\n<p>All demonstrations and practice was done locally with a specially prepared\n<a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/docs/iaas/deployment-examples/cloud-in-a-box/\">Cloud-in-a-Box (CiaB)</a>.\nThis small yet powerful training environment did not only make for a\ntangible setup but also ensure independence from a stable internet connection\nto Europe. The participants thus were enabled to work under realistic conditions - just like\nlater on for operating real SCS clouds.</p>\n<p>The used CiaB was actually a powerful mini computer with 8 Zen4 cores (16 threads),\n96GB of RAM, and 2x4TB NVMe storage. All relevant services were running there:\nCeph for block and object storage, OpenStack for the Virtualization and several\nKubernetes clusters managed by SCS Cluster Stacks.</p>\n<p>Direct access to the infrastructure was provided via a locally operated WLAN\nand via Wireguard tunnels from the participants' laptops - no matter whether\nWindows, macOS or Linux was deployed on these. So they could seamlessly\nswitch between learning and accessing the environment with building practical\nexperience as cloud users and operators.</p>\n<h2>SCS training material: open, flexible and jointly extensible</h2>\n<p>Training material has been created for this course - modular, practical and\nopenly available.</p>\n<p>The structure of it follows the didactic concept: After each knowledge block\nthere are practical assignments that should be worked through by the participants,\non their own or with some support by the trainers as needed. During the course\nin Nairobi, most of the assignments were actually successfully done, though\na few were cut short due to time constraints.</p>\n<p>The material is <a href=\"https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/scs-training/\">available</a>\nas a collection of markdown formatted text. It can easily be extended,\ntransformed into presentation slides (e.g. with HedgeDoc) or transformed\ninto a PDF booklet (~85 pages as of Aug 2025).</p>\n<p>Especially important is that it has been made available under an\nan Open Source License (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC-BY-SA-4.0</a>).\nThis license requires attribution to the original authors (BY) and the\nrepublication of own changes under the same license (SA). The license\nwas chosen deliberately to ensure that future extensions and improvements\nwould be benefiting the whole community again.</p>\n<p>The brands Sovereign Cloud Stack and SCS continue to be owned by the\n<a href=\"https://osb-alliance.com/\">OSBA</a>. Trainings with the SCS name thus should be\ndone by members and in alignment with the <a href=\"https://www.sovereigncloudstack.org/en/network/\">Forum\nSCS-Standards</a> of the OSBA.\nThis ensures a consistent representation and the quality of the trainings.\nCollaboration in the forum and the conduct of trainings is explicitly\nencouraged. Everyone can this way contribute to further spread sovereign\ncloud technology worldwide.</p>\n<p>ðŸ”— Download &#x26; Contribute: <a href=\"https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/scs-training/\">https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/scs-training/</a></p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Special thanks go to the ITU for financing and releasing the training\nmaterials and to GIZ for organizing and funding the training course in Kenya,\nwhich was conducted by Karsten Samaschke\n(<a href=\"https://vanillacore.de/\">VanillaCore</a>) together with myself (Kurt Garloff,\n<a href=\"https://garloff.de/s7n/\">S7n Cloud Services GmbH</a>).
