The OSBA and 14 of its member companies\nare founding the forum SCS-standards effective 2025-01-01. This\nconsortium inside the OSBA takes responsibility for the standards\nand certifications and their further evolution in the future.\nThis also ensures the quality assurance in a sustainable manner.\nAll users of Sovereign Cloud Stack and the whole ecosystem around\nSCS can thus have assurance of relying on a future-proof cloud\ntechnology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\"SCS embodies quality, transparency and interoperability in the IT industry.\nThe core topics of standardization and certification are continued in the\nnewly founding forum SCS-Standards to protect these values.\" explains\nPeter Ganten, chairman of the OSBA.\n</blockquote>\n<h2>14 strong partners engage</h2>\n<blockquote>\n\"SCS needs to be advanced even without public subsidies. If we manage to\nimprove the market conditions and create offerings from various\ncloud service providers that are interoperable and federatable thanks\nto common standards, this will have beneficial effects on the German and\nEuropean cloud economy overall and will lead to long-term success.\nThis is the reason for our members to invest time and money.\" comments\nMarius Feldmann, COO of Cloud&Heat, chairman of ALASCA e.V. and one of\nthe two interim chairs of the forum.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Up to now, 14 companies have collected an annual budget of 257,000 Euros.\nTheir engagement goes beyond the financial support: They are supporting\nthe SCS ideas and the common standards.

There also exists a partnership with ALASCA e.V.. An open development\nprocess is used to jointly define open standards for a modern, federatable\nopen source cloud and container platform. Proven open source components\nare used to implement them in production-grade software. In addition,\noperation knowledge and processes are made transparent to overcome the\nchallenges of providing a highly reliable and secure cloud service to\na high degree. The SCS technology is already used by six public cloud\nproviders in production to provide of truly sovereign and GDPR compliant\ncloud offerings. More setups -- both public and private clouds -- are\nbuilt. SCS also contributes to Gaia-X and delivers the development platform\nfor the Gaia-X Federation Services / Cross-Federation Service Components\n(GXFS/XFSC).</p>\n<h3>About the Open Source Business Alliance – Federal Alliance for Digital Sovereignty e.V.</h3>\n<p>The Open Source Business Alliance (OSBA) is the association of the Open\nSource Industry in Germany.
