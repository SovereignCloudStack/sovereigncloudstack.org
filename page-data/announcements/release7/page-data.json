SCS\noffers a digitally sovereign, secure, comprehensive, standardized,\nand open solution for the virtualization and container layers as base for\ncontainerized applications. The software implements the certifiable SCS\nstandards that have been prepared with the users and operators of SCS.\nAfter some years of real-world usage, there is quite some experience and\nknowledge available, especially around operational topics.</p>\n<h2>SCS Turnkey Solution</h2>\n<p>An important focus of the release 7 (R7) development cycle was to more\nclosely interlink the various components of our modular software stack,\naiming to make it easier for operators to use the complete SCS stack.\nBeyond some improvements in the installation automation, the end-to-end\ninstallation manual is worth mentioning, encompassing all significant\ncomponents. One part of the integration work was the Central API project,\nwhich is meant to expose the functionality of user, virtualization,\nand container management behind one API and which is available as technical\npreview.</p>\n<h2>Strengthening of Upstream Technology</h2>\n<p>Without open source technologies such as Linux, Ceph, OpenStack, or\nKubernetes, SCS would be unthinkable. The members of the SCS community\n(both OSBA employees in the SCS project team as well as contractors and\nusers) are active members of the respective upstream communities and\ncontribute to the technology there. SCS' strategic direction is to\navoid doing improvements exclusively in our own downstream implementation\nbut puts focus on aligning with the upstream technology communities.\nThis is sometimes slower, but results in a more sustainable development\nprocess. Current examples are contributions from the SCS\ncommunity to the domain-manager role in OpenStack, the work on\nthe Cluster-API-Provider for OpenStack to ensure that several control\nplane nodes of a Kubernetes cluster do not (accidentally) end up on the\nsame underlying hardware node (hypervisor) or the work on comprehensive\nencryption of internal connections in kolla-ansible. The first two\nexamples will be part of the next release of SCS and have not yet trickled\nback to R7.</p>\n<h2>Current Software</h2>\n<p>SCS R7 is shipped with current OpenStack (2024.1 Caracal) which can be operated\non several Linux distributions: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS continues to be supported;\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS, Debian 12 and CentOS Stream 9 (and thus RHEL9) have been added. VPN-as-a-Service\nis now also supported and validated with the modern software-defined-networking\ntechnology OVN that we have used by default for some years now. The latest version\nof Ceph (Reef) and Deployment of Ceph via rook are available as Technical\nPreviews and can evaluated already as replacement for the proven Ceph Quincy\ndeployed with ceph-ansible.</p>\n<p>A lot of improvements went into Cluster Stacks. They are using the current\nversion of Cluster API (v1.8) and the current Cluster-API-Provider for OpenStack\n(v0.10) which finally promises a stable API. Recent versions of Kubernetes\n(v1.30/1.31) have been validated. Cluster Stacks can now also use any OCI registry\nfor their resources, facilitating the usage of own versions without requiring github\nreleases. Own Node-Images can easily be provided via your own object storage.\nUsing infrastructure with a private TLS certificate authority for the API is\nnow supported.</p>\n<p>Usage of Cluster Stacks outside of SCS-conforming infrastructure is growing,\ne.g. on Hetzer Cloud. This strengthens the technology and is proof that the\nframework is as flexible as we designed it to be. On SCS infra, we have\nsuccessfully enabled Kamaji (as a technical preview) as an option, where the\ncontrol planes of several workload clusters can be in a shared cluster in order\nto reduce the overhead of creating many clusters.</p>\n<p>The most important improvement under the hood of Cluster Stacks are the\nso-called multi-stage-addons. With their help, we can correctly deal\nwith version dependencies between components, e.g. in case of cluster\nversion upgrades. This helps to ensure a seamless availability of the\ncluster during upgrades. The old Kubernetes-as-a-Service v1 technology\nwas deprecated before and will now no longer be actively maintained.\nAny users still using it should move to cluster stacks urgently now.</p>\n<h2>Operational Aspects and Security</h2>\n<p>The OpenStack Health Monitor has proven really useful to monitor the\nvirtualization layer in SCS. The code has aged though and a new implementation\nwas created. It uses modern technology and can easily be extended with\ncontainer scenario tests. Maintenance and further development has been\nsimplified by this transition significantly.</p>\n<p>Another significant investment in securing the technology happened with\nthe support from specialized penetration testers. We also automated the\npenetration tests in a CI pipeline, so they are run regularly or to validate\nchanges. This continuous security assessment is an important contribution\nto defend against growing cybersecurity threats.</p>\n<h2>SCS-compliant with Open Standards</h2>\n<p>Next to the work on the reference implementation, there was progress in the\narea of standards and certification.\nback in May, <a href=\"https://scs.community/2024/05/13/cost-of-making-an-openstack-cluster-scs-compliant/\">it was shown</a>\nthat SCS-compatible IaaS-v4 compliance can be achieved with moderate effort\nusing Yaook, an implementation that is completely independent of the SCS\nreference implementation.\nNew partnes have been added to the\n<a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/standards/certification/overview/#compliant-cloud-environments\">list of SCS-Clouds</a>:\nAOV, SysEleven, and with Proof-of-Concept environments the KDO Service\nGmbH as well as Cloud&#x26;Heat Technologies GmbH. SysEleven is not using\nthe SCS reference implementation either. Next to the automated daily\nSCS standards compliance checks, the new SCS Compliance Monitor (currently\nstill in test operation) gives a more detailed view on single passed or\nfailed tests and also prepares for transparency on future optional\nrequirements.</p>\n<h3>Further Links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://scs.community/\">Sovereign Cloud Stack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/docs\">Technical documentation SCS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack\">SCS repositories</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.scs.community/docs/category/releases\">Release notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://the-report.cloud/why-digital-sovereignty-is-more-than-mere-legal-compliance/\">SCS notion of digital Sovereignty</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>About the Sovereign Cloud Stack Project</h3>\n<p>SCS has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate\nProtection (BMWK) since July 2021 and is run by the Open Source Business\nAlliance - Bundesverband für digitale Souveränität e.V.. A growing,\ninternational ecosystem of now over 25 companies contributes to the success of\nthe Sovereign Cloud Stack with over 50 software developers.\nThe SCS project provides a fully open reference implementation for a complete\nand production-ready cloud stack. In addition, open\nstandards for a modern, federatable open source cloud and container platform\nare defined together and implemented in an open development process using proven open\nsource components. At the same time, operational knowledge and practice is\nbeing made transparently available to minimize the difficulty of delivering\nhigh-quality and secure cloud services. Already six providers are using SCS\ntechnology productively to operate truly sovereign and GDPR-compliant public\ncloud offerings. Additional SCS-based cloud infrastructure (public and private\nclouds) is under construction. SCS also contributes to\n<a href=\"https://gaia-x.eu/\">Gaia-X</a> and provides the\ndevelopment platform for the Gaia-X Federation Services / Cross-Federation\nService Components (<a href=\"https://www.gxfs.eu/\">GXFS</a>/XFSC).</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"3d090a6c-cc1f-5676-ba42-78041eeadf07","language":"en","slug":"release7","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"defaultLanguage":"en","generateDefaultLanguagePage":false,"routed":false,"originalPath":"/announcements/release7/","path":"/announcements/release7/"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1406175617","1529705390","2744905544"],"slicesMap":{}}
