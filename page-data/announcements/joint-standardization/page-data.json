In addition, a complete, completely openly\ndeveloped and production-ready software implementation is offered together\nwith broad knowledge on how to reliably operate it. Simplifying\nthe operations of modern cloud infrastructure facilitates the emergence\nof a broad interoperable ecosystem of cloud offerings, supporting users\nto achieve a higher level of digital sovereignty (or in other words\na higher level of self-determinism in the digital space). SCS is a project\nof the Open Source Business Alliance e.V. (Federation for Digital Sovereignty)\nand is funded by the BMWK (German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate\nAction). SCS supports the realization of Gaia-X and the German Administrative\nCloud (DVC) and provides a technical implementation with a modular Open\nSource solution.</p>\n<p>After announcing the collaboration between SCS and ALASCA e.V. already\nin January 2023 in a <a href=\"https://scs.community/2023/01/16/collaboration-of-alasca-and-scs/\">joint statement</a>\na lot of joint work has happened throughout the last months especially\nin the area of SCS standardization.</p>\n<p>Starting today, the Special Interest Group for the standardization activities\nof SCS will be governed by both the ALASCA project and the SCS project team\nand coordintated by Dr. Matthias BÃ¼chse from Cloud&#x26;Heat Technologies.\nBuilding on top of already existing standards, the goal is to achieve a\nbroader adoption of SCS standards by more close collaboration with ALASCA\nand also cover the ALASCA technology stack with the cloud-lifecycle management\ntool Yaook. Providing a second standards-compliant implementation of SCS\nstandards on top of Yaook validates the universal nature of the standards.\nThe broader setup also supports the high quality of the evolving standards\nand the sustainability of the SCS standardization efforts. The Special\nInterest Group is open to all cloud providers and integrators that want\nto contribute and provide SCS-compliant services.</p>\n<p>Likewise for ALASCA, the closer collaboration in the evolution of the standards\noffers significant value: The association pursues enabling the digitally\nsovereign setup and operations of own cloud infrastructure by research,\neducational or generally public entities as well as private sector\ncompanies and individuals based on Open Source Software and the connected\nsupply of competencies. With the SCS standards, this effort receives\na unique foundation, upgrading the relevance of the ALASCA-driven\nOpen Source Software. The ALASCA community significantly benefits from\nthe additional support by the SCS community.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"db1d4866-1649-5f98-b9ae-b27b33343008","language":"en","slug":"joint-standardization","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"defaultLanguage":"en","generateDefaultLanguagePage":false,"routed":false,"originalPath":"/announcements/joint-standardization/","path":"/announcements/joint-standardization/"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1406175617","1529705390","2744905544"],"slicesMap":{}}
