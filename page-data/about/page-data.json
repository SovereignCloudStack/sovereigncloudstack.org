These standards provide a reliable foundation for cloud-native applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reference Implementation</strong> <br />\nTo demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the SCS standards, an open-source reference implementation is provided. This implementation serves as a baseline for organizations to build their own sovereign cloud solutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open Operations</strong> <br />\nSCS promotes operational transparency by defining best practices for running and maintaining cloud environments. This ensures consistent and secure cloud operations that align with the SCS principles.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Why SCS?</h3>\n<p>Sovereign Cloud Stack addresses the growing need for data sovereignty, transparency, and flexibility in the cloud ecosystem. By focusing on open-source solutions and community collaboration, SCS empowers organizations to regain control over their digital infrastructure without compromising on innovation or scalability.</p>\n<p>Learn more about SCS and how it drives a sovereign and sustainable digital future.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ee65b67-74c9-52dd-9cf3-0476fded56c4","language":"en","slug":"about","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","de"],"defaultLanguage":"en","generateDefaultLanguagePage":false,"routed":false,"originalPath":"/about/","path":"/about/"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1406175617","1529705390","2744905544"],"slicesMap":{}}
