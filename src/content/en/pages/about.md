## About Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) is a European initiative that provides an open, transparent, and vendor-neutral cloud ecosystem that ensures sovereignty and interoperability.

### The Three Pillars of SCS

1. **Standards** <br />
   SCS defines clear and precise standards to ensure cloud services are interoperable and avoid vendor lock-in. These standards provide a reliable foundation for cloud-native applications.

2. **Reference Implementation** <br />
   To demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the SCS standards, an open-source reference implementation is provided. This implementation serves as a baseline for organizations to build their own sovereign cloud solutions.

3. **Open Operations** <br />
   SCS promotes operational transparency by defining best practices for running and maintaining cloud environments. This ensures consistent and secure cloud operations that align with the SCS principles.

### Why SCS?

Sovereign Cloud Stack addresses the growing need for data sovereignty, transparency, and flexibility in the cloud ecosystem. By focusing on open-source solutions and community collaboration, SCS empowers organizations to regain control over their digital infrastructure without compromising on innovation or scalability.
