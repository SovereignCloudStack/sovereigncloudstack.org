### The Network Behind the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)

The Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) stands for digital sovereignty, interoperability, and the sustainable promotion of open standards in cloud technology. To achieve these goals, SCS is built upon a strong network of committed partners and stakeholders shaping the future of digital transformation.

### **OSBA Forum SCS-Standards**

Since January 1, 2025, the development and quality assurance of the Sovereign Cloud Stack has been managed by the newly established **Forum SCS-Standards** within the Open Source Business Alliance (OSBA). This forum was created to ensure the long-term sustainability and further development of the results from the SCS project funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK).

#### **Goals of the Forum:**

- Advancement and maintenance of SCS standards.
- Implementation of certifications to ensure high quality requirements.
- Promotion of digital sovereignty in Europe through open and federated cloud standards.

"Through the commitment of the founding members to the Forum SCS-Standards within the OSBA, the nonprofit approach, the openness of the standards, and equal access for all market participants are firmly anchored," explains Peter Ganten, Chairman of the OSBA.
